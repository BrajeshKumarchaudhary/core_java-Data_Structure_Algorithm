## Keyword in java

```text
/*
 *abstract -Specifies that a class or method will be implemented later, in a subclass
 *assert -Assert describes a predicate (a true–false statement) placed in a Java program to indicate that the developer thinks that the predicate is always true at that place. If an assertion evaluates to false at run-time, an assertion failure results, which typically causes execution to abort.
 *boolean – A data type that can hold True and False values only
 *break – A control statement for breaking out of loops
 *byte – A data type that can hold 8-bit data values
 *case – Used in switch statements to mark blocks of text
 *catch – Catches exceptions generated by try statements
 *char – A data type that can hold unsigned 16-bit Unicode characters
 *class -Declares a new class
 *continue -Sends control back outside a loop
  *default -Specifies the default block of code in a switch statement
  *do -Starts a do-while loop
  *double – A data type that can hold 64-bit floating-point numbers
  *else – Indicates alternative branches in an if statement
  *enum – A Java keyword used to declare an enumerated type. Enumerations extend the base class.
  *extends -Indicates that a class is derived from another class or interface
  *final -Indicates that a variable holds a constant value or that a method will not be overridden
  *finally -Indicates a block of code in a try-catch structure that will always be executed
  *float -A data type that holds a 32-bit floating-point number
  *for -Used to start a for loop
  *if -Tests a true/false expression and branches accordingly
  *implements -Specifies that a class implements an interface
  *import -References other classes
  *instanceof -Indicates whether an object is an instance of a specific class or implements an interface
  *int – A data type that can hold a 32-bit signed integer
  *interface – Declares an interface
  *long – A data type that holds a 64-bit integer
  *native -Specifies that a method is implemented with native (platform-specific) code
  *new – Creates new objects
  *null -Indicates that a reference does not refer to anything
  *package – Declares a Java package
  *private -An access specifier indicating that a method or variable may be accessed only in the class it’s declared in
  *protected – An access specifier indicating that a method or variable may only be accessed in the class it’s declared in (or a subclass of the class it’s declared in or other classes in the same package)
  *public – An access specifier used for classes, interfaces, methods, and variables indicating that an item is accessible throughout the application (or where the class that defines it is accessible)
  *return -Sends control and possibly a return value back from a called method
  *short – A data type that can hold a 16-bit integer
  *static -Indicates that a variable or method is a class method (rather than being limited to one particular object)
  *strictfp – A Java keyword used to restrict the precision and rounding of floating point calculations to ensure portability.
  *super – Refers to a class’s base class (used in a method or class constructor)
  *switch -A statement that executes code based on a test value
  *synchronized -Specifies critical sections or methods in multithreaded code
  *this -Refers to the current object in a method or constructor
  *throw – Creates an exception
  *throws -Indicates what exceptions may be thrown by a method
  *transient -Specifies that a variable is not part of an object’s persistent state
  *try -Starts a block of code that will be tested for exceptions
  *void -Specifies that a method does not have a return value
  *volatile -Indicates that a variable may change asynchronously
   *while -Starts a while loop
